# hackUIOWA18
Our project consisted of taking a folder of podcast files and constructing a complete webpage based on its information. Once running the podcast command associated with creating the website, the user is then able to upload the resulting files to a web host of their choosing. 

On this website, the user can see the date/time the podcast was created, the title, and an excerpt (if applicable). Additionally, there is also a download link for people that want to download the podcast to their personal listening device. Below that information, there is an audio player that is able to play the podcast. Finally, there is a link to download an RSS Feed in order for users to continually stay updated with the podcast's development over time.
